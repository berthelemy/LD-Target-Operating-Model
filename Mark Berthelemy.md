I've worked in adult learning for the bulk of my professional career.

After starting out in teaching, at both secondary and primary levels - taking leadership roles in IT and Music - I was recruited by Capita in 2000. The UK-based company was setting up an online teacher training programme, designed to help teachers learn how to use technology better in their classrooms.

Despite the timing, for many teachers and schools, being possibly too early, the programme worked with over 30,000 teachers from across the UK. I was one of the senior online mentors - leading a team that helped participants get through the course. 

From there, I moved over to supporting the roll out of Capita's rebadged version of Learnwise, a virtual learning environment for schools; eventually becoming the Product Manager.

I was subsequently asked to join a new digital learning team within Capita Learning & Development, where I became a "Learning Solutions Architect". From this vantage point I was able to gain an insight into the learning and development needs of many private and public sector organisations.

After 12 years at Capita, I went solo. It was a long held ambition to set up my own consulting business. I sold myself as an interpreter between the languages of business, learning and technology - doing a mix of project management, solution design, troubleshooting and procurement support. They were good times - again seeing a whole range of different contexts and needs.

Ten years later and it was time to close the shop as I'd moved to France. These days I still do odd bits of consulting, but mostly I work for CABI, an intergovernmental organisation that "creates and applies knowledge that addresses challenges faced by people around the world". It's a scientific institution, a publishing house and an international development organisation. The team I lead is at the heart of all that - taking the lessons learnt by our scientists and converting them into qualifications and courses for those supporting smallholder farmers around the world.
