A Target Operating Model, or TOM, is a way of describing the future state of an organisation. It's where you want to head towards.

Often, the TOM is described using three main components:

- [People](people)
- [Processes](processes)
- [Technology](technology)

Each of these works in conjunction with the other two.

Sometimes you'll see a TOM described with a diagram. However these tend to have more style than substance. To be remotely useful, the diagram would need to be three dimensional.

Instead, I've decided to create this TOM as a series of linked documents. There is no fixed order in which to read them, although [Processes](processes) is probably the sensible starting point.

This resource is designed for people working within organisational learning & development (L&D). Those in related industries such as Training, Further Education, and Higher Education might find parts of it useful. But the focus is on those who are trying to help their organisations, and the people within them, to become better.

If you have any questions or comments, please [raise an issue on Github](https://github.com/berthelemy/ld-target-operating-model/issues) where this resource is hosted.
